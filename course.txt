Dependency Injection:
    Sw Design Pattern that implements inversion of control for resolving dependencies.
    ~coined by Martin Fowler in 2004
    ~involves 4 roles:
        ~The Service
        ~The Client
        ~The Interface
        ~The Injector

    ~3 ways for a component to get hold of its dependencies:
        ~create dependency using new operator
        ~look up dependency using a global variable
        ~have dependency passed to it where needed (most flexible)

    ~Angular Injection Subsystem is responsible for:
        ~creating component
        ~resolving their dependencies
        ~providing them to other components
